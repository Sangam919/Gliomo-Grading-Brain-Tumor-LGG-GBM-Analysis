 Project Title: Glioma Grading Clinical and Mutation Features

I'm excited to share insights from my latest project where I explored how clinical features and gene mutation profiles impact the grading of Glioma—a type of brain tumor that includes both GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) and LGG (Low-Grade Glioma).
🧠 Key Highlights:
📊 Performed exploratory data analysis on clinical & mutation datasets from UCI
🧬 Investigated the role of critical genes like IDH1, TP53, EGFR, and others in Glioma grading
👨‍⚕️ Analyzed patient demographics (age, gender, race) and their relation to tumor type
🔥 Built correlation heatmaps, co-mutation maps, and used Random Forest to identify feature importance
🧾 Derived insights such as:
GBM patients tend to be older than LGG
IDH1 mutation is highly associated with LGG 
Gene mutation frequency helps distinguish between GBM and LGG grades
This project has not only strengthened my skills in Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, but also deepened my understanding of how data science can contribute to medical research. 📈❤️‍🧬
